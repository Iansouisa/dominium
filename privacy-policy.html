            <p>
              We may transfer your personal data to service providers that carry

              personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to

              Whenever we transfer your personal data outside the EEA, we ensure

              personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in
              an unauthorised way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit
              access to your personal data to those employees, agents,

              know. They will only process your personal data on our

              We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably
              necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
              for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax,
              accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal
              data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we
              reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to
              our relationship with you.

            <p>
              To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
              we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal
              data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
              disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
              process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
              purposes through other means, and the applicable legal,
              regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. By law, we have
              to keep basic information about our clients (including Contact,
              Identity, Financial, and Transaction Data) for six years after
              they cease being clients for tax purposes. In some circumstances,

              You have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation

              <li>
                <strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly
                known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to
                receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to
                check that we are lawfully processing it.
              </li>

                <strong

                  you.</strong
                >
                This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we
                hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
                accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
              </li>
              <li>

                  >Request erasure of your personal data in certain
                  circumstances.</strong
                >
                This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
                where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
                You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
                personal data where you have successfully exercised your right
                to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed
                your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase

                data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate
                interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
                compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
                override your right to object. You also have the absolute right
                to object at any time to the processing of your personal data
                for direct marketing purposes (see opting out of marketing in
                paragraph 4 for details of how to object to receiving direct
                marketing communications).

                We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
                personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
                format. Note that this right only applies to automated
                information which you initially provided consent for us to use
                or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

                in section 4 for details of when we rely on your consent as the
                legal basis for using your data). However, this will not affect
                the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw
                your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able
                to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise
                you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

                This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
                personal data in one of the following scenarios: If you want us
                to establish the data's accuracy; Where our use of the data is
                unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; Where you need us
                to hold the data even if we no longer require it, as you need it
                to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or You have
                objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether
                we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
