              Limitation of Liability

            <p>
              Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
              liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any
              provision of these Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the
              foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You
              through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything
              through the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the avoidance of doubt, this limitation of liability applies
              only to claims arising from Your use of the Website. Any liability
              related to Marketing Services provided under a Service Agreement
              shall be governed by the terms of that Service Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
              shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special,
              incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
              (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss
              of data or other information, for business interruption, for
              personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way
              related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party
              software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or
              otherwise in connection with any provision of these Terms), even
              if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility
              of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential
              purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
              limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
              which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
              these states, each party's liability will be limited to the
              greatest extent permitted by law.

              respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
              all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
              with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of
              merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and

              dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
              limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
              undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the
              Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results,
              be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
              systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any

              products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be
              uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy,
              reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
              through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the
              content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free
              of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or
              other harmful components.

              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
              warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
              consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations
              may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and
              limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
              greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
